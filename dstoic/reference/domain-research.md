# Research Domain Framework

Use this framework when analyzing sessions focused on research work: hypothesis testing, discovery, analysis, insight generation, and knowledge synthesis.

## Analysis Dimensions

### 1. Hypotheses & Validation

**Key questions:**
- What hypotheses were tested during these sessions?
- Which hypotheses were validated, invalidated, or remain inconclusive?
- What evidence supported or refuted each hypothesis?
- What new hypotheses emerged from the research?
- What would change your confidence level in these conclusions?

**Look for:**
- Initial assumptions and how they evolved
- Evidence quality and sufficiency
- Alternative explanations considered
- Confidence levels and uncertainty
- Surprising or counterintuitive findings

### 2. Research Methods & Effectiveness

**Key questions:**
- What research methods were used (interviews, analysis, synthesis, etc.)?
- Which methods yielded the most valuable insights?
- Which methods consumed time without proportional value?
- What methodological improvements emerged during the work?
- What would you do differently in a similar research effort?

**Look for:**
- Data gathering approaches and their efficiency
- Analysis frameworks and their applicability
- Synthesis techniques and insight generation
- Iteration patterns (when did you pivot or dig deeper?)
- Time investment vs. insight yield

### 3. Insights & Discoveries

**Key questions:**
- What new insights emerged that weren't expected?
- What patterns or themes emerged across the research?
- What insights are most actionable or impactful?
- What insights challenge existing beliefs or approaches?
- What insights raise new questions worth pursuing?

**Look for:**
- Novel connections between concepts
- Patterns that explain multiple observations
- Counterintuitive findings
- Practical implications of theoretical insights
- Gaps or contradictions that need resolution

### 4. Sources & Information Quality

**Key questions:**
- What sources proved most valuable for this research?
- What sources were less useful than expected?
- How did you evaluate source credibility and relevance?
- What sources are worth returning to for future research?
- What information gaps remain that need better sources?

**Look for:**
- Primary vs. secondary sources and their utility
- Source diversity and potential bias
- Timeliness and relevance of information
- Source accessibility and reusability
- Citation or reference patterns

### 5. Analysis Frameworks & Tools

**Key questions:**
- What analysis frameworks guided the research (SWOT, Porter's Five Forces, Jobs-to-be-Done, etc.)?
- Which frameworks were effective for this domain?
- Which frameworks were less helpful than anticipated?
- What custom or hybrid frameworks emerged?
- What analytical tools or techniques enhanced the work?

**Look for:**
- Framework selection rationale
- Framework application and adaptation
- Framework limitations discovered
- Cross-framework insights
- Tool effectiveness (spreadsheets, visualization, AI assistance)

## Start/Stop/Continue Framework (Research)

### Start (New Practices to Adopt)
- Research methods that yielded high-value insights
- Analysis frameworks that proved illuminating
- Sources or source types worth exploring more
- Synthesis techniques that revealed patterns
- Documentation approaches that captured learnings effectively

### Stop (Practices to Eliminate)
- Research methods that consumed time without proportional value
- Analysis frameworks that obscured more than they revealed
- Sources that proved unreliable or irrelevant
- Synthesis approaches that led to shallow insights
- Documentation patterns that lost valuable context

### Continue (Effective Practices to Maintain)
- Research methods that consistently deliver insights
- Analysis frameworks that remain applicable
- High-quality sources worth maintaining access to
- Synthesis techniques that work well
- Documentation practices that preserve context

## Output Structure for Research Insights

When writing research domain retrospectives, structure your analysis as:

1. **Hypothesis Outcomes**: What was validated, invalidated, or remains uncertain
2. **Method Effectiveness**: Which research approaches worked best
3. **Key Insights**: Novel discoveries and their implications
4. **Source Evaluation**: What sources proved valuable and why
5. **Framework Assessment**: Which analytical frameworks were effective
6. **Research Start/Stop/Continue**: Concrete recommendations for future research

Focus on **extracting lessons about the research process itself** - what approaches to inquiry, analysis, and synthesis yield the most valuable and actionable insights.

## Special Considerations for Research Work

### Distinguishing Good from Great Research
- Good research answers the question asked
- Great research reveals questions you should have asked
- Look for moments when the research direction pivoted based on findings

### Balancing Depth vs. Breadth
- When did going deeper pay off vs. diminishing returns?
- When did exploring adjacent areas unlock new insights?
- What signals indicated it was time to stop digging?

### Synthesis vs. Analysis
- Analysis breaks things down; synthesis builds new understanding
- Look for moments when disparate findings connected into larger patterns
- Identify what enabled synthesis (time, fresh perspective, discussion)

### Managing Uncertainty
- How was uncertainty quantified or communicated?
- What level of certainty was "good enough" to act on?
- What assumptions needed validation vs. acceptance?
