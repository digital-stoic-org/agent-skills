# CLAUDE.md Example

> This is an **example** CLAUDE.md for inspiration. CLAUDE.md is personal—adapt it to your own patterns and preferences.

## Project Context

- Brief description of what this project does
- Key technologies: [list them]
- Architecture overview in 2-3 sentences

## Rules

- `**/.in/`: initial context for project bootstrap (if you use this pattern)
- Add your own project-specific rules here

## Communication Principles

- **Ask clarification questions** when needed or before starting big tasks
- **Never hallucinate or assume information** without supporting facts
- **When you don't know, say so** — honesty over speculation

## Git Commits

**Conventional Commits:** `type(scope): description`
- Types: feat|fix|docs|refactor|test|chore|perf|build|ci
- Keep commits atomic and focused

**Pre-commit checklist:**
1. Show `git status` + `git diff --staged`
2. List files + proposed message
3. Wait for confirmation

## Security

**NEVER read/parse sensitive files:**
- `.env*`, `*credentials*`, `*secrets*`
- `*.key`, `*.pem`, `*.crt`
- `.aws/*`, `.azure/*`

Warn if requested, get explicit confirmation.

## 🧠 Personal Cognitive Preferences (Author's Example)

> The sections below are **verbatim from the author's personal CLAUDE.md**. They exemplify how cognitive preferences can be encoded. These reflect *one person's* thinking style—yours will differ.

### Planning

- **Boulder → Pebbles**: Break complex features into trackable stories
- Ask user upfront if OpenSpec should be used for the task
- Use OpenSpec for boulders (multi-step, architectural, ambiguous scope)
- Skip OpenSpec for pebbles (single file, obvious implementation)

### Style

**Human output (responses, docs, explanations):**
- **Visual-first:** Mermaid diagrams by default for technical (e.g., architecture/flows/data) AND non-technical (e.g., decisions/processes/comparisons). Colorize with classDef/fill/stroke. **ALWAYS use black text** (`color:#000`) for nodes with colored backgrounds.
- **Structured data:** YAML/JSON with emoji (✅❌🎯⚠️🚀)
- **OVERRIDE: Use emojis liberally** ✅❌🎯🚀🔍💾🧪📦⚠️✨🎨🔧

**LLM context (`*-llm.md`, specs, agent prompts):**
- **Token-optimized:** All `-llm.md` files must be optimized for tokens. Strip prose, keep directives/facts/structure only.
- **Visual structure:** Mermaid diagrams for complex flows/hierarchies/relationships. More efficient than prose explanations.
- **Structured data:** Clean YAML/JSON without emoji. Optimized for parsing.
- **Markdown:** Semantic headings, bullets, code blocks. No decorative formatting.

### Mermaid

- Wrap labels in quotes: `["Label"]`
- Multi-target connections: use `&` operator: `A -->|label| B & C & D`
- Define nodes inside subgraphs before referencing them
- **Black text mandatory:** ALL classDef with colored fills MUST include `color:#000` for readability
  - Example: `classDef success fill:#90EE90,stroke:#333,color:#000`
